## 9. Navigation & Authentication Analysis - üîÑ CRITICAL

### 9.1 Current Navigation Issues

#### Header Navigation Tabs Analysis:
```typescript
const navItems: NavItem[] = [
  { name: 'Home', href: '/' },           // ‚úÖ Public - Landing page
  { name: 'Search', href: '/search' },   // ‚ùå Auth Required - Will redirect to login
  { name: 'Watchlist', href: '/watchlist' }, // ‚ùå Auth Required - Will redirect to login
  { name: 'Recommendations', href: '/recommendations' }, // ‚ùå Auth Required - Will redirect to login
  { name: 'About', href: '#about' },     // ‚úÖ Public - Anchor link to landing page section
];
```

#### Authentication Levels by Page:
- **Public Pages (No Auth Required)**:
  - `/` (Landing Page) - ‚úÖ Working
  - `/login` - ‚úÖ Working
  - `/signup` - ‚úÖ Working
  - `/pricing` - ‚úÖ Working
  - `/request-password-reset` - ‚úÖ Working
  - `/password-reset` - ‚úÖ Working
  - `/email-verification` - ‚úÖ Working

- **Protected Pages (Auth Required)**:
  - `/search` - ‚úÖ Working (redirects to login if not authenticated)
  - `/watchlist` - ‚úÖ Working (redirects to login if not authenticated)
  - `/recommendations` - ‚úÖ Working (redirects to login if not authenticated)
  - `/account` - ‚úÖ Working (redirects to login if not authenticated)
  - `/checkout` - ‚úÖ Working (redirects to login if not authenticated)

### 9.2 Navigation Problems & Solutions

#### Problem 1: Unauthenticated Users See Protected Links
- **Issue**: Navigation shows Search, Watchlist, Recommendations tabs to unauthenticated users
- **Impact**: Users click these links and get redirected to login, creating poor UX
- **Solution**: Implement conditional navigation based on authentication status

#### Problem 2: Missing User Menu for Authenticated Users
- **Issue**: No user profile menu or logout option for authenticated users
- **Impact**: Users can't easily access account settings or logout
- **Solution**: Add user menu with profile, settings, and logout options

#### Problem 3: Inconsistent Authentication Flow
- **Issue**: Some pages redirect to login, others show different content
- **Impact**: Inconsistent user experience
- **Solution**: Standardize authentication handling across all protected pages

### 9.3 Required Implementation Tasks

#### Task 1: Dynamic Navigation Based on Auth Status
```typescript
// Update header.tsx to show different navigation based on auth status
const { data: user, isLoading } = useAuth();

const publicNavItems = [
  { name: 'Home', href: '/' },
  { name: 'About', href: '#about' },
  { name: 'Pricing', href: '/pricing' },
];

const authenticatedNavItems = [
  { name: 'Home', href: '/' },
  { name: 'Search', href: '/search' },
  { name: 'Watchlist', href: '/watchlist' },
  { name: 'Recommendations', href: '/recommendations' },
  { name: 'About', href: '#about' },
];
```

#### Task 2: User Menu Component
- Create dropdown menu for authenticated users
- Include: Profile, Account Settings, Logout
- Show user avatar/name

#### Task 3: Authentication-Aware Header
- Show "Sign In" / "Start Watching" for unauthenticated users
- Show user menu for authenticated users
- Handle loading states properly

#### Task 4: Protected Page Enhancements
- Add proper loading states
- Improve redirect UX with better messaging
- Consider showing preview content for unauthenticated users

### 9.4 Implementation Priority

#### High Priority (Immediate):
1. **Dynamic Navigation**: Update header to show appropriate tabs based on auth status
2. **User Menu**: Add profile dropdown for authenticated users
3. **Auth State Handling**: Proper loading states and error handling

#### Medium Priority (Next Sprint):

#### Low Priority (Future):
1. **Guest Mode**: Allow limited browsing without authentication
2. **Social Features**: Public profiles and shared watchlists
3. **Advanced User Management**: Admin panel and user roles

## 10. Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **LLM Provider Risk**: Regularly review OpenRouter/DeepSeek's service status, pricing, and terms. Maintain abstraction for rapid provider switching if needed.
- **Build System Risk**: Monitor for new import path issues as components are added or modified.
- **Navigation UX Risk**: Test authentication flows thoroughly to ensure smooth user experience.
