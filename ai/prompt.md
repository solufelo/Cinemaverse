Cinemaverse is a personal and collaborative movie & TV tracking platform, enabling users to track what they’re watching, rate shows, and optionally share progress with friends. The product will be developed using the OpenSaaS.sh template — featuring Google Auth, Stripe integration, SendGrid, OpenAI API access, Tailwind styling, and scheduled cron jobs. The UI layer will be built using blocks.mvp-subha.me. We'll follow the Vertical Slice technique: building fully functional features one at a time, from simplest to more complex.

>We’ve completed this phase of CinemaVerse build. Please write documentation in the ai/docs folder following our existing conventions. Don't restate implementation details already in the code — instead, explain: What this phase of the implementation accomplishes. Where the main logic is located (e.g., src/features/import/csvMapper.ts). How a dev or reviewer might interact with or extend this code. This doc will help other team members (or an LLM) understand and iterate on the current phase. Keep it clean, direct, and connected to the overall plan and PRD.
