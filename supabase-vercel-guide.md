# Split Deployment: Supabase + Vercel (Advanced Free Option)

## Strategy: Split Your App

Since most free tiers are limited, we can split your Wasp app:
- **Frontend**: Deploy to Vercel (free, fast)
- **Backend**: Deploy to Render (free with cold starts)
- **Database**: Supabase (generous free tier)

## Why This Works for Portfolio

✅ **Frontend always fast** (Vercel CDN)
✅ **Permanent free hosting**
✅ **Professional appearance**
✅ **Shows advanced deployment skills**

## Setup Process

### 1. Extract Frontend for Vercel

Create a separate frontend build:

```bash
# In your app directory
wasp build
cp -r .wasp/build/web-app frontend-only
cd frontend-only

# Modify to work as static site with API calls
# (This requires some code changes)
```

### 2. Backend to Render
- Deploy server component to Render
- Use the render-build.sh script we created

### 3. Database to Supabase
- 500MB storage free
- 2GB bandwidth/month
- Real-time features included

## Limitations

❌ **Requires code modifications** (complex)
❌ **Not a true Wasp deployment**
❌ **Takes more setup time**

## Verdict: Not Recommended

This approach requires significant code changes and defeats the purpose of using Wasp.
